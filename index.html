<p >this is the pesto manifesto: an improvised recipe of sorts</p>
<p>when making pesto, here are some things to keep in mind:</p>
<p>1. must use organic garlic if you live in the 21st Ce.<br/>
2. must use fresh basil from your mom or neighbor’s garden.<br/>
3. must use pine nuts.<br/>
4. no food processing allowed.</p>
<p>These are important because pesto is a delicacy that deserves<br/>to be made
	RIGHT. Pasta should not be smothered in mediocrity!<br/> or should it?
<p>1. become inspired by mediocre productions.<br/>
2. don’t covert production and experimentation recipe<br/>
3. always leave the edges rough, so that someone can cut themselves<br/>
4. a photoshop’d joke is DEEP and MEANINGFUL<br/>
5. take the knife to cultural icons and produce: produce the produce<br/>for the
recipe and destroy the recipe<br/>
6. follow and muddy up every else’s recipe; pun and play, annihilate<br/>and
resurrect MEANING</p>
<p>keep in mind:</p>
<p>pesto is delicious when it’s made FRESH.</p>
