				this is the icecream manifesto
				icecream must be eaten with extra cookie dough.
				if you get icecream from dairy queen you have to eat it upside down.
				if you live in the south you have to eat ice cream on august 26th every year.
				all icecream MUST be hand spun by a grandpa who is very wise.
				if icecream is melted it is no longer icecream, but is flavored milk.
				SPRINKLES SPRINKLES SPRINKLES
				even if it is snowing outside you can eat icecream.
				if you get more than one flavor, put your favorite flavor on the bottom to savor last.
